# Changelog

Steps refer to ROADMAP.md. Breaking changes come with migration notes.

## Unreleased

### Logging and asserts (Roadmap 0.4)
- `WLW_LOG(Category, Level, "fmt", ...)`: levels Verbose, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal; engine categories
  `LogCore`, `LogApp`, `LogRender`, `LogShader`, `LogAudio`, `LogPlatform`, `LogUI`, `LogFX` (kit: `LogKit`); games
  declare their own with `WLW_LOG_CATEGORY(LogMyGame)`. Every engine message now has its category.
- Levels below `WLW_LOG_COMPILE_LEVEL` (Debug in debug builds, Info in release) compile to nothing.
- Runtime filters: `SetLogFilter("Render=Verbose,Audio=Warning,*=Info")`, `SetLogLevel`; on desktop the
  `WLW_LOG` environment variable sets one at startup.
- Records carry time, thread id (`T0` = main), category, level and file:line. Desktop lines read
  `[12.345][T0][Render][warning] text`; logcat gets `[Render] text` with the matching priority.
- Sinks: the platform output, an in-memory history of the last 512 records (`RecentLogs`), a log file
  (`StartLogFile`, flushed every line; debug builds write `<save dir>/log.txt` and keep the run before as
  `log.txt.prev`), and `AddLogSink` callbacks. Any thread may log. A Fatal record stops the program after
  it's written everywhere.
- `wlw/core/assert.h`: `WLW_ASSERT` (debug builds; release with the CMake option `WLW_ENABLE_ASSERTS`),
  `WLW_VERIFY` (always evaluated: logs an Error and returns false), `WLW_UNREACHABLE`, and
  `SetAssertHandler` for tests. A debugger, if attached, breaks on failures.
- Platform: `platform::WriteLog(const LogRecord&)`, `IsDebuggerAttached()`, `BreakIntoDebugger()`.
- Removed `wlw/core/logger.h` (`FAIL_IF`).

Migration:
- `WLW_LOG_INFO/WARN/ERROR` and `wlw::Log` still work (category General).
- `if (FAIL_IF(bad, "msg " << x)) return;` becomes `if (!WLW_VERIFY(!bad, "msg %s", x)) return;`. The condition
  is inverted (VERIFY states what must hold), and the message is printf-style. Include `wlw/core/assert.h`.
- Code that got `<sstream>` through `wlw/scene/node.h` (it included `logger.h`) must include it itself.

### Golden images (Roadmap 0.3)
- `tests/gpu`: a new test binary `wlw_gpu_tests` (CTest label `gpu`) draws 7 fixed scenes (lit cubes, shadows,
  transparency, instancing, sprites, bloom, canvas shapes + text + images) into an offscreen viewport of a
  hidden window and compares them with `tests/gpu/references/*.png`. On a mismatch the actual picture and a
  diff (bad pixels in red) go to `build/<preset>/tests/gpu/gpu_output/`; `wlw_gpu_tests --update` rewrites
  the references. References come from Mesa llvmpipe (strict); a real GPU compares more loosely.
- CI runs them on Linux under xvfb with llvmpipe and uploads the output when they fail. Windows CI skips them.
  CI no longer runs for pushes that change only Markdown files.
- `tests/support` (`wlw_test_support`): PNG load/save and image comparison, unit-tested in `wlw_tests`.
- Engine: `Window::Create(size, title, WindowOptions{.visible = false})` makes a hidden window (desktop);
  `RenderingDriver::ReadPixels(RenderTarget&)` reads a target back as RGBA8, top row first;
  `RenderingDriver::GpuName()`.

Migration: none; `Window::Create`'s new argument has a default. Code that implements `RenderingDriver` (only
the engine's GL driver does) must add `ReadPixels` and `GpuName`.

### CI (Roadmap 0.2)
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push: Windows MSVC Debug (Release too on `main` and
  manual runs), Linux clang Debug with ASan + UBSan, Android arm64 (NDK 30, API 24: engine, kit and Snake).
  Every test runs (`ctest -j`); vcpkg packages and ccache are cached; a newer push cancels the older run.
- New presets: `linux-asan`, `android-arm64` (needs `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`) and test presets
  (`ctest --preset <name>`), so each CI job runs the same way locally.
- `WLW_SANITIZE` (`address;undefined`, off by default) builds every target with those sanitizers.
- `WLW_BUILD_SAMPLES` works on Android (off by default there); Snake builds as `libwlw_snake.so`.
- Linux: the engine links pthread, dl and m (miniaudio).

### Tests (Roadmap 0.1)
- The engine tests use doctest 2.4.12 (vendored in `third_party/doctest`). The 24 suites are one binary,
  `wlw_tests` (one `TEST_SUITE` per file, a shared main in `tests/test_main.cpp`); every `TEST_CASE` is
  its own CTest test (`doctest_discover_tests`), so `ctest -j` runs cases in parallel and a failure
  names the case and prints both values.
- Snake's rule tests use doctest too (`snake_game_tests`, CTest names `snake: <case>`).
- Removed `tests/check.h`; `Near()` moved to `tests/test_helpers.h`.

Migration (only for code that wrote tests against `check.h`): include `test_helpers.h`, turn each test
function into `TEST_CASE("...")`, drop `main()`, and put compound conditions in double parentheses:
`CHECK((a && b))`.
